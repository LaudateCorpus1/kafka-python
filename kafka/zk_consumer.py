    When the :class:`ZKPartitioner` enters the
    :attr:`~PartitionState.FAILURE` state, it is unrecoverable
    and a new :class:`ZKPartitioner` should be created.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from kazoo.client import KazooClient
        client = KazooClient()

        qp = ZKPartitioner(client, consumer_group, topic)

                qp.release_set()

            elif qp.allocating:
                qp.wait_for_acquire()

    **State Transitions**

    When created, the :class:`ZKPartitioner` enters the
    :attr:`PartitionState.ALLOCATING` state.

    :attr:`~PartitionState.ALLOCATING` ->
    :attr:`~PartitionState.ACQUIRED`

        Set was partitioned successfully, the partition list assigned
        is accessible via list/iter methods or calling list() on the
        :class:`ZKPartitioner` instance.

    :attr:`~PartitionState.ALLOCATING` ->
    :attr:`~PartitionState.FAILURE`

        Allocating the set failed either due to a Zookeeper session
        expiration, or failure to acquire the items of the set within
        the timeout period.

    :attr:`~PartitionState.ACQUIRED` ->
    :attr:`~PartitionState.RELEASE`

        The members of the party have changed, and the set needs to be
        repartitioned. :meth:`ZKPartitioner.release` should be called
        as soon as possible.

    :attr:`~PartitionState.ACQUIRED` ->
    :attr:`~PartitionState.FAILURE`

        The current partition was lost due to a Zookeeper session
        expiration.

    :attr:`~PartitionState.RELEASE` ->
    :attr:`~PartitionState.ALLOCATING`

        The current partition was released and is being re-allocated.
